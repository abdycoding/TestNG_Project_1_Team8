# OpenMRS TR Sprint Project

**Project URL**: [OpenMRS Project](https://demo.openmrs.org/)

## Project Description

OpenMRS is an open-source electronic medical record system (EMR) designed to improve patient data management in healthcare facilities, particularly in low-income regions. It supports functions like digitizing medical records, patient tracking, treatment planning, and data analysis. This project aims to automate the testing of OpenMRS features using Java, Selenium, TestNG, and other tools to ensure reliable software performance.

The main objective of this project is to write automated test scripts for web-based functionalities, such as login, patient management, account settings, and more. We aim to create reliable test scenarios, organize tests, and implement logging with Page Object Model architecture.

## Features & User Stories

1. **Login Error Validation**: Ensure the system properly handles incorrect login attempts.
2. **User Authentication**: Verify that users can securely log in and log out.
3. **Patient Registration**: Validate the process of entering patient details and creating records.
4. **Account Settings Access**: Ensure users can access the account settings page.
5. **Patient Search**: Doctors should be able to search for specific patients.
6. **Patient Deletion**: Doctors should be able to remove a patient from the system.
7. **List All Patients**: Validate that the system can display all patients.
8. **Patient Records Merging**: Verify the functionality of merging patient records.
9. **Incorrect Timezone for Appointments**: Check for timezone issues when scheduling appointments.
